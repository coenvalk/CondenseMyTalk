# CondenseMyTalk
Automatic video lecture summarizing platform

## Background
For students with learning differences such as attention deficit disorder and ADHD,
sitting and focusing on one topic for hours is a great challenge, causing students
to get distracted, uninterested, and fall behind in class. Lecture notes offer a condensed
form of the lecture, but students that learn best through audio/visual stimulation have difficulty
retaining information in this way. CondenseMyTalk is a platform that automatically creates
lecture summaries from longer videos, that condenses the information of the two hour lecture
into a 5 to 10 minute video.
